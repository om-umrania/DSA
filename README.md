# Topicwise-Solutions-To-Coding-Questions

Solutions to the algorithmic problems in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?problemType=full&page=1), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=problem-solving), [Interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset) written in **C++** and **JAVA**

## What you can find in this repository

We have solved quite a number of problems from several topics. See the below table for further details.

## How to contribute?

1. Fork the repository
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

If you want to update the readme file as well, you have to install [Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_environment_setup.htm) and [Jsoup](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsoup/jsoup_environment.htm). Then you can run the [UpdateReadme.java](./UpdateReadme.java) file to update the readme file.

## When to contribute?

1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size (In this case, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.)
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method (In this case, comment your solution in the main file and make a pull request.)
5. If you want to update the [UpdateReadme.java](./UpdateReadme.java) file

## Format for solution files

1. Paste the link for the question within comments.
2. Paste the solution.
3. Save with proper extension name.

## Description of auto-updation of Readme file

[UpdateReadme.java](./UpdateReadme.java) is the main file. It reads information (that are obtained online) from [OnlineInfo.csv](./OnlineInfo.csv) file. If you have updated the readme file with some online information without adding into csv file, then you need to run [OnlineToCSV.java](./OnlineToCSV.java) file to read that from readme and store in the csv file.

For difficulty level, csv file is already updated. For other online information columns you'll have to update it.
